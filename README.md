# Cryptocurrency Tracker in React.js

## My approach
Created this project because I wanted to improve my knowledge of React.js and combine my passion for cryptocurrencies, so I created a page that follows and displays the latest prices. Pulls data from the Coin Geckco API which allows me to access and display various cryptocurrency prices, and be arranged under certain parameters like market cap, price etc. 

Also has a search function which runs within the page and doesn't require the website to reload, saving time.
